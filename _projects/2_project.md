### Description

My team was tasked with creating a deployable cooling device that is capable of removing 100 watts from the body for areas where high humidity prevents effective evaporative cooling. To do so, we developed a convective body cooling suit for individuals to wear during 95+% humidity to cool down. We designed a water-driven cooling subsystem with water-blocks located at high-temperature regions in the body to dissipate heat more effectively from the body. Furthermore, we optimized the design using calculations of heat dissipation for intended use case in nominal human subjects.
