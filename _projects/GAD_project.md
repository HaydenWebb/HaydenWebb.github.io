### Description
My team was tasked with creating a device that would help to help a client with Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita be able to apply a grasping force on everyday objects. This project aids in the development process for devices to help individuals like our clieant to live normal lives and be more autonomous. To do so, we manufactured an underactuated robotic glove for performing power & precision grasps in daily activities. This was done through two subsystems. The first was a cable-driven mechanism for furling and unfurling of fingers, mimicking the tendon-pulley system found in biomimetic hands. The second was an Arduino-based flexor system that read thumb furling to perform various grasps.
