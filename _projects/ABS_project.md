### Description

The Sempionatto Research Group develops wearable biosensors that collect and analyze sweat, blood, and other biofluids to monitor the wearerâ€™s health. These wearable sensors must be flexible and thus are made by screen printing the electrode design with a conductive ink. Since existing screen-printing machines are bulky and expensive, the electrodes used in these sensors are often screen-printed by hand, which is time-consuming, inconsistent, and wastes a large amount of ink. The goal of this project is to build a desktop-sized printer that automates this process while minimizing wasted ink. The mid-semester checkpoint that summarizes the work can be found below

### Personal Contribution

Independently developed the overall design of the gantry including the X & Y movement systems. This includes the pictured lock differential, machined top plate, and electronic undercarriage. Personally lead and completed the physical construction of the device including the waterjet cutting, 3D printing, and laser-cutting utilized in the device's fabrication. Additionaly managed team work, budget, and deadlines through project management skills. <br>
