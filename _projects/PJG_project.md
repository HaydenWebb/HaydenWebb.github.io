### Abstract

Current robot hands with parallel jaw are limited in their capabilities for full spatial manipulation due to the lack of manipulation between their fingers. This presents a unique challenge in achieving precise control and adaptability for objects of diverse geometries. To this end, I am currently developing an innovative design, called the CLAMP (CompLiant Adaptive Manipulator for Parallel-Jaws), that integrates active surfaces, compliant fin-rays, and a remote center of compliance (RCC) beam system, to enable versatile manipulation without compromising stability in parallel jaw hands. Having already finished the design implementation, I'm currently developing a robust self identification manipulation algorithm to parameterize the gripper's capabilities. Further information and an accompanying paper for this work will be provided soon, as I plan to submit this work to the 2024 Winter IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL) journal.

### Personal Contribution

Developed the mechanical design of the Parallel Jaw Gripper and am currently developing self identification manipulation algorithms to parameterize and test the handâ€™s manipulation capabilities for objects of variable geometry. Code base for the test environment came from the [Yale OpenHand Project](https://www.eng.yale.edu/grablab/openhand/) and was further modified to accommodate the CLAMP's components. <br>
