I am a recent graduate of [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) where I obtained a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering (Minor in Engineering Design), where I served as a Robotics Research Assistant in the [RobotPi Lab](https://robotpilab.github.io/) under the direction of [Dr. Kaiyu Hang](https://hangkaiyu.github.io/). I will be attending [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu) in the fall to obtain a [PhD in Robotics](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/mae/phd/robotics-phd/).

 I am broadly interested in bio-mimetic robotics, integrable technology, and mechatronic devices that can be utilized to physically manipulate the world around us, and I explore these various topics in my research. Currently, I am working on the development & design of new forms of robotic in-hand manipulator systems in order to further the gripping and manipulating capabilities of current robot hands.

Additionally, I work for both the [Rice University Mechanical Engineering Department](https://mech.rice.edu/) and [Rice University Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen](https://oedk.rice.edu/) as a Teaching Assistant to further promote and teach Engineering in the Rice undergraduate & graduate community.
